# TSQ Repository Analysis

**Purpose and Overview**

This repository implements a thread-safe queue (TSQ) as a proof-of-concept for C++11 concurrency features. The main component is a templated `ThreadSafeContainer` class that builds upon the standard STL FIFO queue to provide thread-safety for multiple producer and consumer threads. The implementation uses a mutex and two condition variables to manage concurrent accessâ€”one condition variable handles full queue scenarios, and another manages empty queue conditions. While the README explicitly notes this is not a production-ready container, it serves as an educational demonstration of C++11's threading capabilities, particularly focusing on mutexes, condition variables, and thread synchronization patterns.

**Features and Technologies**

The repository showcases several key features implemented in modern C++. At its core, the `ThreadSafeContainer` template class provides four primary queue operations: `tryAdd` and `tryRemove` for non-blocking attempts, and `waitAdd` and `waitRemove` for blocking operations that use condition variables when the queue is full or empty. The container supports graceful shutdown through a `shutdown` method that throws `ShutdownException` on subsequent operations, and includes a `clear` method for cleanup. The implementation leverages C++14 standard features including templates, move semantics (with deleted copy and move constructors/assignments), mutex locks, and condition variables. For testing, the repository includes a multi-threaded test harness (`TSCTest.cpp`) that spawns 19 writer and 19 reader threads with random sleep durations to stress-test the queue under concurrent access. The build system uses CMake with an optional ThreadSanitizer (TSAN) integration for detecting data races, demonstrating awareness of testing best practices for concurrent code. A simple random number generator utility is also included to introduce variability in thread timing during tests.
